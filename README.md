# Sudoku

Java implementation of the Sudoku game.

## Game description

After you start the game you can choose a difficulty, then the puzzle shows and a timer starts.
You can get the desired numbers in by left or right mouse clicking on a tile.
To increase the value, you must click the left mouse button, to decrease you must click the right one.
If you manage to solve the puzzle in a receord number of seconds, you can type your nickname in and
it'll show it in the "toplist" menupoint.
In the main menu you can also choose the "solver" option, which solves a board you take in,
unless it's not a valid board.
